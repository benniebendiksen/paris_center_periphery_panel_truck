These changes modified the city's boundaries, but the arrondissements of the centre have remained at the heart of Paris. Since housing was expensive in the center, many of these migrants settled in the banlieues.\n\nOn the map, the limits of Paris stand out as a dense ring of streets and buildings that gradually fade into more open space. By zooming toward this edge, we can see where the built-up core ends and the surrounding communes begin—places that would later be labeled as *banlieues* and treated as separate from the prestigious center."

In *Paris Noir*, \"Le grand frère\" depicts a young man accused of stealing by a police officer and asked for his papers—an everyday experience for many in the banlieues.\n\nTo the west of the historic core, the map highlights **Neuilly-sur-Seine**, a wealthy residential commune often associated with upper-middle-class and elite households. Its tree-lined avenues and proximity to the center underline how some suburban spaces function as privileged extensions of Paris rather than as marginalized banlieues."

Originally built as a fortress in 1190 under King Philippe Auguste, it was transformed into a public museum in 1793 during the French Revolution and today is the most visited museum in the world—another powerful emblem of the Parisian center that immigrants help sustain but often cannot inhabit."

This medieval cathedral, begun in the 12th century, has long symbolized national identity and spiritual authority—precisely the kind of iconic image that is sold to visitors, while the inequalities of the banlieues remain out of frame."
