These changes modified the city's boundaries, but the arrondissements of the centre have remained at the heart of Paris. Since housing was expensive in the center, many of these migrants settled in the banlieues.

This shows how racialized groups are often being **watched, policed, and controlled.**"

Many newcomers arrive with **a dream of Paris that was \"sold to them.\"** Once they're there, they're confronted with a society that puts them in a box based on origin, skin color, social class, and zip code. Wherever they're from, they share the same experience upon arrival: they're \"foreigners,\" and don't fit the phenotype associated with a \"real\" Parisian."

Even today, the Paris metropolitan region displays a sharp division between Paris—the territory of upper-class professions, intellectual elites, and high-value infrastructure—and the banlieue, where workers, employees, social housing, and a racialized population live. From this, we can see how a system of segregation took hold and has become a contemporary reality."
